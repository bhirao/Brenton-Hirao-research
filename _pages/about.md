I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Oregon, visitor at the University of California, Davis, and member of the [UC Davis Observational Seismology](https://amtseismo.github.io/) research group. 

My research broadly focuses on large-scale earthquake detection and high-resolution earthquake catalog construction. I design efficient, modular workflows to analyze seismic waveform data at the multi-terabyte scale to understand the mechanics of magmatic and faulting systems and their hazard potential.

Volcano-tectonic earthquakes at Mount St. Helens (accepted to JGR Solid Earth)
--

We search for hidden, noneruptive volcano-tectonic earthquakes at the Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington, USA using a matched-filter and relative location procedure. We find roughly ~31,000 volcano tectonic earthquakes between 2008 to 2024, roughly 7 times greater than contained in the USGS network catalog.

We find evidence that the Mount St. Helens volcanic complex is repressurizing after the last eruption. In addition, we make the case the volcano-tectonic earthquakes that occur between eruptions are mostly driven by volatiles from the upper-crustal magmatic reservoir. Here, they migrate up the conduit and interact with upward changes in vertical permeability and phase changes in the resident magma that are emplaced during the past eruptions.
