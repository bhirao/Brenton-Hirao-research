About Me
======

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Oregon, visitor at the University of California, Davis, and member of the UC Davis Observational Seismology research group. 

My research broadly focuses on large-scale earthquake detection and high-resolution earthquake catalog construction. I design efficient, modular workflows to analyze seismic waveform data at the multi-terabyte scale to understand the mechanics of magmatic and faulting systems and their hazard potential.
