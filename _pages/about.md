I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Oregon, visitor at the University of California, Davis, and member of the [UC Davis Observational Seismology](https://amtseismo.github.io/) research group. 

My research broadly focuses on large-scale earthquake detection and high-resolution earthquake catalog construction. I design efficient, modular workflows to analyze seismic waveform data at the multi-terabyte scale to understand the mechanics of magmatic and faulting systems and their hazard potential.
